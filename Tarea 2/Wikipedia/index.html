    <h2><i>History</i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The YouTube channel was created by Rea on August 21, 2006;<sup><a href="#r1">[1]</a></sup> his name 
        was inspired by <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing" target="_blank">The West Wing</a></i> 
        character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_West_Wing_characters#Office_of_the_White_House_Counsel">Oliver Babish.</a>
        <sup><a href="#r2">[2]</a></sup>
        Three videos unrelated to Binging with Babish were uploaded to the account, 
        two in 2007 and one in 2010. 
        The first episode of Binging with Babish aired on February 10, 2016, 
        which is about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation" target="_blank"><i>Parks and Recreation</i></a> 
        burger cook-off.<sup><a href="#r3">[3]</a></sup>
        For the first 20 episodes, Binging with Babish used the opening lines of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier" target="_blank"><i>Frasier</i></a> theme song, 
        "Tossed Salads and Scrambled Eggs," 
        performed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Grammer" target="_blank">Kelsey Grammer</a>. On later episodes of season 1, 
        the <i>Frasier</i> theme was omitted in order to 
        avoid intellectual 
        property rights issues as he started to monetize the videos. 
        The show now begins with a clip of the food item being recreated, 
        followed by Rea entering the kitchen while welcoming the viewers. 
        Intitially, Rea primarily used electronic rock band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatat" target="_blank">Ratatat</a>'s song "Cream on Chrome" 
        as background music in episodes, but since monetizing his channel the majority of 
        episodes now use the song "Add And" by royalty-free composer Broke For Free. 
        In the earlier episodes, Rea's face was not shown on camera, 
        only his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirt" target="_blank">shirt</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apron" target="_blank">apron</a>, accompanied by Rea's voice-over. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Its first video to be widely circulated aired on November 14, 2016, making the "Moistmaker" 
        sandwich from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends" target="_blank"><i>Friends</i></a>. The channel's growth has been driven by fans 
        promoting its videos on 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and other social media platforms. 
        Rea created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon" target="_blank">Patreon</a> account to earn an income and, 
        after reaching a monthly $10,000 goal, 
        quit his day job to work full-time on Binging with Babish,<sup><a href="#r4">[4]</a></sup>
        which is released weekly on Tuesdays.<sup><a href="#r5">[5]</a></sup> He spent $6,000 on a 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony" target="_blank">Sony</a> 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera" target="_blank">digital camera</a>, 
        lights and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing_software" target="_blank">editing software</a>, 
        and does the production, editing and narration for the videos. 
        The cost of each episode, according to Rea, "varies wildly" 
        because of the ever-changing variety of 
        food and ingredients used.<sup><a href="#r4">[4]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Rea posts recipes for the dishes on his website<sup><a href="#r6">[6]</a></sup> and on October 3, 2017, 
        he published a cookbook titled Eat What <i>You Watch: A Cookbook for Movie Lovers</i>, 
        containing 40 recipes featured in film.<sup><a href="#r7">[7]</a></sup> He started the series 
        Basics with <i>Babish on October</i> 12, 2017, teaching preparation of 
        basic recipes, stocking up on and using essential tools and equipment 
        for cooking, as well as a variety of cooking techniques.<sup><a href="#r2">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        On March 19, 2019, at the end of a video that involved recreating the iconic 
        cake from the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(series)" target="_blank">Portal</a></i> 
        series of video games, Rea premiered a trailer 
        for his new show, <i>Being with Babish</i>, 
        which premiered on March 22, 2019.
        <sup><a href="#r8">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="#r9">[9]</a></sup> 
        The new show focuses on Rea giving back 
        to his fans and to the people who have helped him in his various episodes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day" target="_blank">April Fools' Day</a> 2019, he 
        released a video titled "Binging with Babish: Brock's Donuts from Pokémon,"
        <sup><a href="#r10">[10]</a></sup> where he made rice ball-shaped doughnuts to make fun of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4Licensing_Corporation#Criticism_and_controversy" target="_blank">4Kids Entertainment changing rice 
        balls in the original Pokémon anime into doughnuts</a>. This was immediately followed by a video where 
        he "corrected" his error by making proper

            During each episode, Rea prepares step-by-step instructions on the preparation of film and television-related meals.
            <sup><a href="#r4">[4]</a></sup>  The show is typically filmed at his torso, 
            in the kitchen of his New York City apartment with a voice-over added in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-production" target="_blank">post-production</a>. 
            Each episode contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_humor" target="_blank">dry humor</a><sup><a href="#r12">[12]</a></sup>  and is paced at a fast speed. After creating the dish as it originally appeared, some episodes includes Rea's interpretation of the recipe.<sup><a href="#r5">[5]</a></sup> 
        </p>
        <p>
            The show has featured many guest appearances from other YouTube

            <sup><a href="#r18">[18]</a></sup> Rea's 4 million

            On some occasions, Rea has hosted actors from the shows

            films which he has featured numerous times on the show.

            the carving fork prop used in a prominent scene
